INTRODUCTION                                    *mercenary*

When editing a file inside a mercurial repository, the following commands will
be made available to you.

COMMANDS                                        *mercenary-commands*

                                                *mercenary-:HGblame*
:HGblame                    Blame the current file, showing the annotations in
                            a vertical split to the left. NOTE: if lines have
                            been added or deleted since the last revision, the
                            blame may not line up. This is a limitation of `hg
                            blame`, which does not annotate working copy
                            changes.

                            Examples:

                            :HGblame

                                                *mercenary-:HGshow*
:HGshow {rev}               Show the full commit message and diff for the
                            specified revision.

                            Examples:

                            :HGshow 16132
                            :HGshow de8c6fb78d6b
                            :HGshow p1()

                                                *mercenary-:HGcat*
:HGcat {rev} {path}         Show the specified file at the specified revision.

                            Examples:

                            :HGcat 1 app.yaml
                            :HGcat p1() app.yaml
                            :HGcat 42cbe67706ac %

                                                *mercenary-:HGdiff*
:HGdiff [rev]               Open up the current file at the specified revision
                            (p1() if not specified) in a vertical split, then
                            colorize the diff between the files.

                            In the case of a merge, both parents will be
                            opened in vertical splits.

                            Examples:

                            :HGdiff
                            :HGdiff .^2
                            :HGdiff 42cbe67706ac
